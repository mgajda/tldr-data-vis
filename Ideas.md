# Software

* [HighCharts](http://www.highcharts.com/)
* [D3.js](http://d3js.org/)
* or maybe higher level [C3.js](http://c3js.org/samples/data_load.html) supports loading from CSV and is based on D3.js.
* [CanvasJS](http://canvasjs.com/download-html5-charting-graphing-library/)
* [mermaid](https://github.com/knsv/mermaid) for flowcharts and diagrams

Not a good fit:
* [Gephi](http://gephi.org) - not a front-end
